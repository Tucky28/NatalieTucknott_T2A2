### R2 Why is it a problem that needs solving?

For lenders, bad debt can be a significant issue as it represents loans or financing agreements that are unlikely to be repaid in full, if at all. This can result in significant financial losses, as well as increased operational costs associated with debt collection efforts or legal proceedings. Additionally, bad debt can negatively impact a lender's reputation and ability to secure future funding or investments. Therefore, lenders need to carefully manage their risk exposure and use various strategies, such as risk-based pricing, to mitigate the risk of bad debt and ensure the long-term financial health of their business.
